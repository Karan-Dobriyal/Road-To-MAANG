// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length consisting of an equal number of positive and negative integers.

// You should rearrange the elements of nums such that the modified array follows the given conditions:

// Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
// For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in nums is preserved.
// The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.
// Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
// Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
// Explanation:
// The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].
// The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
// Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions.  
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [-1,1]
// Output: [1,-1]
// Explanation:
// 1 is the only positive integer and -1 the only negative integer in nums.
// So nums is rearranged to [1,-1].
 

// Constraints:

// 2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105
// nums.length is even
// 1 <= |nums[i]| <= 105
// nums consists of equal number of positive and negative integers.
